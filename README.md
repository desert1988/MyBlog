# Guide in Journeys.
I started in September 2018  project GuideInJourneys. 
Main idea: network to share travel experiance, find cool travel options and keep track of Places you are visit during lifetime. 

Also you can add any Place, ask information you need and guides/locals can provide information and help for you.
